# Stock-Prediction---Linear-Regression
Use linear regression to predict the future stock prices of a company based on historical data.

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection
Gather historical stock price data for a particular company. You can use financial APIs or download data from financial websites.

### 2. Feature Selection
Choose relevant features that you believe might influence stock prices. This could include historical prices, trading volume, economic indicators, or even social media sentiment about the company.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the data. Handle missing values, scale the data if necessary, and split it into training and testing sets.

### 4. Model Training
Use linear regression to train a model on the training data. The independent variables would be your chosen features, and the dependent variable would be the stock price.

### 5. Prediction
Use the trained model to predict future stock prices on the testing set.

### 6. Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

### 7. Analysis
Analyze the coefficients of the linear regression equation to understand the impact of each feature on the stock price. This addresses the understanding relationships aspect.

### 8. Trend Analysis
Visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices over time to identify trends.
